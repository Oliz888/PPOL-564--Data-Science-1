# PPOL 564/Data Science 1 Fall 2022

This first course in the core data science sequence teaches Data Science for Public Policy
(DSPP) students how to synthesize disparate, possibly unstructured data in order to draw
meaningful insights. Topics covered include the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python; data
wrangling and visualization; merging datasets using both defined join keys and probabilistic/"fuzzy" matching; data extraction via APIs; an introduction to SQL for manipulating data stored in databases; and what I call a "data science grab-bag": fun topics in data science for working with or visualizing complex and unstructured data (text as data; spatial data; interactive visualizations).

In addition, students will be exposed to command line and Git and Github for version control and reproducible
research. The objective of the course is to teach students how incorporate data into their
decision-making and analysis. No prior programming experience is assumed or required.


## Textbook v. DataCamp

- **Is there a textbook?** There is no textbook. For specific programming questions, DataCamp videos will give good introductions to the concepts and then stackoverflow/various online resources help fill in the gaps. 

- **What is a DataCamp module and how will I keep track of them?** A module in DataCamp consists of two components. First is a short introductory video to a concept like writing a loop (which you can click through if you already know the concept). Next is a series of tasks where they'll ask you to write code to do something, you submit, and you can progress to the next task when your code successfully does what it's supposed to. To keep track of them, we have a course page hosted within DataCamp that you will sign up for with your Dartmouth email. 

All modules given as assignments will be assigned on that page. As a result, the course schedule gives the module's general name. The modules should be completed *before* the corresponding class, so that you can more easily work on the in-class activity.
