# PPOL 564/Data Science 1 Fall 2022

**Course description**: This first course in the core data science sequence teaches Data Science for Public Policy
(DSPP) students how to synthesize disparate, possibly unstructured data in order to draw
meaningful insights. Topics covered include the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python; data
wrangling and visualization; merging datasets using both defined join keys and probabilistic/"fuzzy" matching; data extraction via APIs; an introduction to SQL for manipulating data stored in databases; and what I call a "data science grab-bag": fun topics in data science for working with or visualizing complex and unstructured data (text as data; spatial data; interactive visualizations).

In addition, students will be exposed to command line and Git and Github for version control and reproducible
research. The objective of the course is to teach students how incorporate data into their
decision-making and analysis. No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

**Goals**: After completing this course, the students will be able to:

- Use Python to write user-defined functions
- Use Python to work with various data structures: lists, numpy arrays, Pandas dataframes, and so on
- Be able to manipulate a variety of data in Python: flat file data; spatial data; text data
- Be able to produce static and interative visualizations in Python
- Write SQL queries to pull, aggregate, and summarize data stored in database tables

## Course policies

- **Attendance policies**: we will take attendance and it will be factored into your participation/"team player" grade; as described at this page, that grade will include classroom participation, participation on Slack, and group project contributions. 
- **Late assignment policies**: see [this evaluation/grading page](https://rebeccajohnson88.github.io/PPOL564_datascience1_fall22/docs/eval_grades_py.html)
- **Canvas site**: A Canvas course site is set up for this course. While this Jupyter book contains details of the assignments, Canvas will contain specific deadlines and course announcements. Students can access the course site at http://canvas.georgetown.edu/. Support for Canvas is available at 202-687-4949. 
- **Other setup**: see this page for setup notes for Python [software setup](software_setup).


## Required Reading

- **Is there a textbook?** There is no textbook. For specific programming questions, DataCamp videos will give good introductions to the concepts and then stackoverflow/various online resources help fill in the gaps. 

- **What is a DataCamp module and how will I keep track of them?** A module in DataCamp consists of two components. First is a short introductory video to a concept like writing a loop (which you can click through if you already know the concept). Next is a series of tasks where they'll ask you to write code to do something, you submit, and you can progress to the next task when your code successfully does what it's supposed to. To keep track of them, we have a course page hosted within DataCamp that you will sign up for with your Dartmouth email. 

All modules given as assignments will be assigned on that page. As a result, the course schedule gives the module's general name. The modules should be completed *before* the corresponding class, so that you can more easily work on the in-class activity.
